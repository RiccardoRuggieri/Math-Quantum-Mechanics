# Quantum Mechanics Course - Polytechnic of Milan

Repo for 'Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics' course at the Polytechnic of Milan, Master Course in Mathematical Engineering (AY 2023-2024). This repository contains homework assignments provided by the course instructor and my solutions to those assignments.

## Course Overview

1. **Crisis of Classical Physics**

2. **Postulates of Quantum Mechanics**

3. **Hilbert Spaces and Operator Theory**
   - Fourier transform, Sobolev spaces and distributions; linear operators: adjoint and inverse operator, symmetric, self-adjoint and unitary operators, projectors; Heisenberg uncertainty relation; self-adjointness criterion and self-adjoint extensions; spectrum and resolvent; spectral theorem and probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics; spectral decomposition; compact operators; mixed states and density matrices; Stone theorem and existence of the dynamics.

4. **Free Particle and Harmonic Oscillator**
   - time evolution of wave packets, dispersion and interference, semiclassical limit; harmonic oscillator: spectrum, creation and annihilation operators, coherent states.

5. **Hydrogen Atom**
   - Self-adjointness, spectrum, angular momentum, and eigenfunctions.
