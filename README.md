# Quantum Mechanics Course - Polytechnic of Milan

Repo for 'Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics' course at the Polytechnic of Milan, Master Course in Mathematical Engineering (AY 2023-2024). This repository contains homework assignments provided by the course instructor and my solutions to those assignments. 

(Final grade: 30 cum laude / 30).
